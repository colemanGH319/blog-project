# Welcome to the Blog Project!

[Deployed on Heroku](https://mc-blog-demo.herokuapp.com/)

## Introduction

This project was completed as part of the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy. It is intended to demonstrate an understanding of the basic workflow of a Django project while reinforcing some front-end design concepts.

## About

The blog was built with Django using a SQLite database engine to store posts, comments and user information. The templates for the web pages were written in HTML5 and CSS/Bootstrap and a minimal amount of JavaScript (mainly just a [Medium Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor)). Finally, the project was deployed to Heroku.
